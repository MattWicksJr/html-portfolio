<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Tulsa, OK. Graduated from Jenks HS and attended the University of Oklahoma, where I was a
  student athlete (ran track and was an All Big 12 Hurdler). I graduated with a Bachelor's in Multi-disciplinary Studies,
  focus in Health & Education. I then obtained a Master's Degree in Human Relations in 2016.

<p>After college, I worked at a Boys Home for some time, and then moved back to Tulsa where I partnered in pipelining
  teachers of color into the Tulsa Public Schools district (we were losing teachers to Texas and surrounding states).
  I then pivoted and became an elementary School counselor at a language immersion school. Shortly after that, and
  where I am now, I work with teen parents as a Fatherhood Coordinator. And now I'm wanting to transition into the
  Tech Industry</p>

<p>I love to coach (track & field). I love traveling, cigars, hosting/spending time with family and friends.
  I love theology. And I enjoy relaxing.
